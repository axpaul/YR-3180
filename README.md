### Python Script Overview

This Python script communicates with the **YR-3180** module using **Modbus RTU** over a serial (RS485/TTL) connection ‚Äî without any external libraries like `pymodbus`, just using `pyserial`.

#### How it works:
1. A **Modbus RTU request frame** is manually built:
   - Slave address: `0x01`
   - Function code: `0x03` (Read Holding Registers)
   - Starting register: `0x0000`
   - Quantity: `2` registers
   - A CRC is calculated and appended

2. The request is sent over the serial port (e.g., `COM7` on Windows).

3. The response is parsed to extract **2 registers** (4 bytes).

4. These 4 bytes are combined into a **32-bit integer**, which is then converted into a weight value in **kilograms**.

## Calibration Instructions

Press and hold the minus key, do not put weight on the sensor, press the setting key to change the value to 0.  
Press Set again and zero point calibration is completed.

### Press and hold the minus key to calibrate the zero point

| Step | Code | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 01 | AD | Zero-point AD acquisition code value, do not put weight on the sensor, wait for 2 seconds, press the setting button to save the zero-point acquisition code. |
| 02 | PL | Enter the weight value corresponding to the zero-point code value. There was no weight on the sensor just now, so the value is set to 0. |
| 03 | -END | Displaying `END` indicates that the calibration is completed and it will automatically return to the working state. |

---

Press and hold the plus button, put the weight on the sensor, press the setting button to change the value to the weight, press the setting button again, and the full scale calibration is completed.

### Long press the plus button to calibrate the full scale

| Step | Code | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 01 | AD | For the full-scale AD sampling value, a weight must be placed on the sensor. After waiting for 2 seconds, press the setting button to save the full-scale coding value. (More than 20% of sensor range) |
| 02 | PL | Enter the weight value corresponding to the full-scale code value. This value will be set to the weight just placed on the sensor. Press the Set button to save. |
| 03 | -END | Displaying `END` indicates that the calibration is completed and it will automatically return to the working state. |
